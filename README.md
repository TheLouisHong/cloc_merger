# How to use
1. Load Old/Previous csv output.
2. Load new csv output.
3. Click merge.

# What does it do
Merge two CLOC output without reordering the file.

# Why
I mark which files I've worked on in a excel sheet. Everytime cloc outputs in a random order. 
So I needed a custom merger that would update new code count without reordering the entire output file.
